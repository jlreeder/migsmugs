This repository contains the records kept for Migs Mugs, the official fan blog of Jonathan Migliori: [[http://migsmugs.tumblr.com/][http://migsmugs.tumblr.com/]].

* Useful Commands
** List contents of img
This lists the contents of the img file in the proper format for the list I keep:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stat -f "| %N | %Sm |" -t "[%Y-%m-%d]" * | pbcopy
#+END_SRC
* Colors
- Banner yellow: #FFDE00
* Tumblr size limit
- For static images, make sure the file is no larger than 10MB and is either a JPEG or a PNG.
* Best Practices
- Image format: PNG
  - JPG doesn't always come out looking right
- Image dimensions: ~500 x 500
  - Any larger and the image is hard to see (it is not resized by Tumblr)
